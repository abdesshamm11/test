About Kiwi ---------- Chris Colbert began the Kiwi project in December 2013 in an effort to create a blisteringly fast UI constraint solver. Chris is still the project lead.  The Nucleic Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Nucleic project and its subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: http://github.com/nucleic. The current team consists of:  * Chris Colbert  Our Copyright Policy -------------------- Nucleic uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Nucleic. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Nucleic source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Nucleic Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Nucleic repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # Copyright (c) 2013-2024, Nucleic Development Team. # # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License. # # The full license is in the file LICENSE, distributed with this software. #------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ",,A fast implementation of the Cassowary constraint solver,>=3.10,2024-12-24T18:30:51,0.1.0,1.4.8,True,,,,,,,,,,False,False

              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets ""[]""

         GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
         
         Version 3.1, 31 March 2009
         
         Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
         
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
         license document, but changing it is not allowed.
         
         This GCC Runtime Library Exception (""Exception"") is an additional
         permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
         3 (""GPLv3""). It applies to a given file (the ""Runtime Library"") that
         bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
         the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
         
         When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
         certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
         program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
         non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
         header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.
         
         0. Definitions.
         
         A file is an ""Independent Module"" if it either requires the Runtime
         Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
         interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
         on the Runtime Library.
         
         ""GCC"" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
         modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
         the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
         subsequent versions published by the FSF.
         
         ""GPL-compatible Software"" is software whose conditions of propagation,
         modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
         the license of GCC.
         
         ""Target Code"" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
         target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
         input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
         phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
         format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
         for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
         
         The ""Compilation Process"" transforms code entirely represented in
         non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
         Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
         use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
         part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
         understood as starting with the output of the generators or
         preprocessors.
         
         A Compilation Process is ""Eligible"" if it is done using GCC, alone or
         with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
         work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
         optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
         Eligible Compilation Process.
         
         1. Grant of Additional Permission.
         
         You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
         combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
         propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
         all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
         may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
         consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
         
         2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
         
         The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
         presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
         requirements of the license of GCC.

                             GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                                Version 3, 29 June 2007
         
          Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
          of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
         
                                     Preamble
         
           The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
         software and other kinds of works.
         
           The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
         to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
         the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
         share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
         software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
         GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
         any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
         your programs, too.
         
           When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
         price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
         have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
         them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
         want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
         free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
         
           To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
         these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
         certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
         you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
         
           For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
         gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
         freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
         or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
         know their rights.
         
           Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
         (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
         giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
         
           For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
         that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
         authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
         changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
         authors of previous versions.
         
           Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
         modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
         can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
         protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
         pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
         use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
         have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
         products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
         stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
         of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
         
           Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
         States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
         software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
         avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
         make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
         patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
         
           The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
         modification follow.
         
                                TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
           0. Definitions.
         
           ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
         
           ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
         works, such as semiconductor masks.
         
           ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
         License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and
         ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.
         
           To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
         in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
         exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the
         earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.
         
           A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
         on the Program.
         
           To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without
         permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
         infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
         computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
         distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
         public, and in some countries other activities as well.
         
           To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
         parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
         a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
         
           An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices""
         to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
         feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
         tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
         extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
         work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
         the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
         menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
         
           1. Source Code.
         
           The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work
         for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source
         form of a work.
         
           A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official
         standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
         interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
         is widely used among developers working in that language.
         
           The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other
         than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
         packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
         Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
         Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
         implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
         ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component
         (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
         (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
         produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
         
           The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all
         the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
         work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
         control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
         System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
         programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
         which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
         includes interface definition files associated with source files for
         the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
         linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
         such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
         subprograms and other parts of the work.
         
           The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
         can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
         Source.
         
           The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
         same work.
         
           2. Basic Permissions.
         
           All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
         copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
         conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
         permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
         covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
         content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
         rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
         
           You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
         convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
         in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
         of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
         with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
         the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
         not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
         for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
         and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
         your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
         
           Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
         the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
         makes it unnecessary.
         
           3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
         
           No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
         measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
         11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
         similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
         measures.
         
           When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
         circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
         is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
         the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
         modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
         users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
         technological measures.
         
           4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
         
           You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
         receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
         appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
         keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
         non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
         keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
         recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
         
           You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
         and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
         
           5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
         
           You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
         produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
         terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
         
             a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
             it, and giving a relevant date.
         
             b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
             released under this License and any conditions added under section
             7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
             ""keep intact all notices"".
         
             c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
             License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
             License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
             additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
             regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
             permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
             invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
         
             d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
             Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
             interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
             work need not make them do so.
         
           A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
         works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
         and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
         in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
         ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
         used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
         beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
         in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
         parts of the aggregate.
         
           6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
         
           You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
         of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
         machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
         in one of these ways:
         
             a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
             (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
             Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
             customarily used for software interchange.
         
             b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
             (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
             written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
             long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
             model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
             copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
             product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
             medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
             more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
             conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
             Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
         
             c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
             written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
             alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
             only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
             with subsection 6b.
         
             d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
             place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
             Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
             further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
             Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
             copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
             may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
             that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
             clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
             Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
             Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
             available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
         
             e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
             you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
             Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
             charge under subsection 6d.
         
           A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
         from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
         included in conveying the object code work.
         
           A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any
         tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
         or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
         into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
         doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
         product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a
         typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
         of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
         actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
         is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
         commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
         the only significant mode of use of the product.
         
           ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods,
         procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
         and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
         a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
         suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
         code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
         modification has been made.
         
           If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
         specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
         part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
         User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
         fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
         Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
         by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
         if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
         modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
         been installed in ROM).
         
           The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
         requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
         for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
         the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
         network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
         adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
         protocols for communication across the network.
         
           Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
         in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
         documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
         source code form), and must require no special password or key for
         unpacking, reading or copying.
         
           7. Additional Terms.
         
           ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this
         License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
         Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
         be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
         that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
         apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
         under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
         this License without regard to the additional permissions.
         
           When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
         remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
         it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
         removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
         additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
         for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
         
           Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
         add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
         that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
         
             a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
             terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
         
             b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
             author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
             Notices displayed by works containing it; or
         
             c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
             requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
             reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
         
             d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
             authors of the material; or
         
             e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
             trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
         
             f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
             material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
             it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
             any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
             those licensors and authors.
         
           All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further
         restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
         received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
         governed by this License along with a term that is a further
         restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
         a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
         License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
         of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
         not survive such relicensing or conveying.
         
           If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
         must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
         additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
         where to find the applicable terms.
         
           Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
         form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
         the above requirements apply either way.
         
           8. Termination.
         
           You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
         provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
         modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
         this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
         paragraph of section 11).
         
           However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
         license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
         provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
         finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
         holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
         prior to 60 days after the cessation.
         
           Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
         reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
         violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
         received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
         copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
         your receipt of the notice.
         
           Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
         licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
         this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
         reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
         material under section 10.
         
           9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
         
           You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
         run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
         occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
         to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
         nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
         modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
         not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
         covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
         
           10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
         
           Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
         receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
         propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
         for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
         
           An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an
         organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
         organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
         work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
         transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
         licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
         give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
         Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
         the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
         
           You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
         rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
         not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
         rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
         (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
         any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
         sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
         
           11. Patents.
         
           A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
         License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
         work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".
         
           A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims
         owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
         hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
         by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
         but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
         consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
         purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant
         patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
         this License.
         
           Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
         patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
         make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
         propagate the contents of its contributor version.
         
           In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express
         agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
         (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
         sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a
         party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
         patent against the party.
         
           If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
         and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
         to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
         publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
         then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
         available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
         patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
         consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
         license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have
         actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
         covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
         in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
         country that you have reason to believe are valid.
         
           If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
         arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
         covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
         receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
         or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
         you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
         work and works based on it.
         
           A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within
         the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
         conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
         specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
         work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
         in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
         to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
         the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
         parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
         patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
         conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
         for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
         contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
         or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
         
           Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
         any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
         otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
         
           12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
         
           If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
         otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
         excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
         covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
         License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
         not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
         to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
         the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
         License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
         
           13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
         
           Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
         permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
         under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
         combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
         License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
         but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
         section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
         combination as such.
         
           14. Revised Versions of this License.
         
           The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
         the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
         be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
         address new problems or concerns.
         
           Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
         Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
         Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the
         option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
         version or of any later version published by the Free Software
         Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
         GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
         by the Free Software Foundation.
         
           If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
         versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
         public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
         to choose that version for the Program.
         
           Later license versions may give you additional or different
         permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
         author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
         later version.
         
           15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
         
           THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
         APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
         HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY
         OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
         THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
         PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
         IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
         ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
         
           16. Limitation of Liability.
         
           IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
         WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
         THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
         GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
         USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
         DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
         PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
         EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
         SUCH DAMAGES.
         
           17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
         
           If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
         above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
         reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
         an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
         Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
         copy of the Program in return for a fee.
         
                              END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
                     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
         
           If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
         possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
         free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
         
           To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
         to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
         state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
         the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
         
             <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
             Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
         
             This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
             it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
             the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or

         The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
         src/regex/tre*) is Copyright © 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed
         under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The
         included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in
         the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.

         The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is
         Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.
         
         The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was
         originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
         domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
         in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.
         
         The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011

         The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under
         the standard MIT terms.
         
         The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
         Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
         by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
         integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.
         
         The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is
         licensed under the standard MIT terms.
         
         The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
         and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
         under the standard MIT terms.
         
         All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
         produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
         by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
         contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
         can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
         omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
         interest of source tree size.
         
         In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
         (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
         applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
         the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
         license, and to use these files without any requirement of
         attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:

         This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
         the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
         to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
         negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
         permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
         obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.Copyright (c) 2005-2023, NumPy Developers.

               the copyright owner that is granting the License.
         
               ""Legal Entity"" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
               other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
               control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
               ""control"" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
               direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
               otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
               outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

               ""Source"" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
               including but not limited to software source code, documentation
               source, and configuration files.
         
               ""Object"" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

               ""Work"" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
               copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
               (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
               ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
               the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
               ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including

               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         ==========================
         
         Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
         Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
         as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
         principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
         
         In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
         National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
         in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
         software.
         
         In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
         BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
         year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
         Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
         https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
         created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
         Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
         
         All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for
         the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
         releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
         the various releases.

         Footnotes:
         
         (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
             the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
             a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
             GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
             other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
         
         (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
             because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
             CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
             is ""not incompatible"" with the GPL.
         
         Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
         direction to make these releases possible.

         ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
         is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
         annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
         original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works

         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
         Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
         3. Grant of Patent License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
         made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
         such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
         that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
         of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
         submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
         Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
         patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
         for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
         4. Redistribution.
         
         You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
         in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
         provided that You meet the following conditions:
         
         You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
         this License; and
         You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
         changed the files; and
         You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
         all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
         of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
         Derivative Works; and
         If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its distribution, then any
         Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
         attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
         that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
         following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
         Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
         with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
         Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
         the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
         License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
         You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
         provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
         modifying the License.
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
         additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
         distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
         provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
         with the conditions stated in this License.
         
         5. Submission of Contributions.
         
         Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
         for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
         conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
         any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
         such Contributions.
         
         6. Trademarks.
         
         This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
         service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
         reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
         reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
         
         Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
         Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
         including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
         NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
         solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
         redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
         permissions under this License.
         
         8. Limitation of Liability.
         
         In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
         contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
         and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
         or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
         out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
         damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
         any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
         been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
         
         While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
         offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
         other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
         in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
         sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
         agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
         accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

             2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

             3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
             4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
             5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
             6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
             7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
             8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
             9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         ---- LLVM Exceptions to the Apache 2.0 License ----
         
         As an exception, if, as a result of your compiling your source code, portions
         of this Software are embedded into an Object form of such source code, you
         may redistribute such embedded portions in such Object form without complying
         with the conditions of Sections 4(a), 4(b) and 4(d) of the License.
         
         In addition, if you combine or link compiled forms of this Software with
         software that is licensed under the GPLv2 (""Combined Software"") and if a

Libgfortran is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3, or (at your option) any later version.  Libgfortran is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.  Under Section 7 of GPL version 3, you are granted additional permissions described in the GCC Runtime Library Exception, version 3.1, as published by the Free Software Foundation.  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License and a copy of the GCC Runtime Library Exception along with this program; see the files COPYING3 and COPYING.RUNTIME respectively.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  ----  Full text of license texts referred to above follows (that they are listed below does not necessarily imply the conditions apply to the present binary release):  ----  GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION  Version 3.1, 31 March 2009  Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  This GCC Runtime Library Exception (""Exception"") is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (""GPLv3""). It applies to a given file (the ""Runtime Library"") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.  When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.  0. Definitions.  A file is an ""Independent Module"" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.  ""GCC"" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.  ""GPL-compatible Software"" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.  ""Target Code"" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.  The ""Compilation Process"" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.  A Compilation Process is ""Eligible"" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.  1. Grant of Additional Permission.  You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.  2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.  The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.  ----  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  Preamble  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  TERMS AND CONDITIONS  0. Definitions.  ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.  ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.  To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.  A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.  To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.  To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.  An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.  1. Source Code.  The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work.  A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.  The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.  The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.  2. Basic Permissions.  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to ""keep intact all notices"".  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.  A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.  ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.  7. Additional Terms.  ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.  8. Termination.  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.  11. Patents.  A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".  A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.  In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.  A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.  14. Revised Versions of this License.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.  Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"".  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as ""Not a Contribution.""
        
              ""Contributor"" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets ""{}""

              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same ""printed page"" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

        ## About the Jupyter Development Team
        
        The Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.
        This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.
        
        The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:
        https://github.com/jupyter/.
        
        ## Our Copyright Policy
        
        Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
        over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these
        contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter
        source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
        institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter
        Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
        changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
        their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
        change to one of the Jupyter repositories.
        
        With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
        to indicate the copyright and license terms:

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations. To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work. A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work. A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to ""keep intact all notices"". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"". A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"". You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

                               Version 3, 29 June 2007
        
         Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
                                    Preamble
        
          The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
        software and other kinds of works.
        
          The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
        to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
        the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
        share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
        software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
        GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
        any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
        your programs, too.
        
          When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
        them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
        want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
        free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
        
          To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
        you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
        
          For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
        gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
        freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
        or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
        know their rights.
        
          Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
        
          For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
        that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
        authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
        changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
        authors of previous versions.
        
          Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
        modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
        can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
        protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
        pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
        use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
        have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
        products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
        stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
        of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
        
          Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
        avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
        make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
        patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
        
          The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow.
        
                               TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
          0. Definitions.
        
          ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
        
          ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
        works, such as semiconductor masks.
        
          ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
        License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and
        ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.
        
          To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
        in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
        exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the
        earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.
        
          A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
        on the Program.
        
          To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without
        permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
        infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
        computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
        distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
        public, and in some countries other activities as well.
        
          To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
        parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
        a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
        
          An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices""
        to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
        feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
        tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
        extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
        work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
        the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
        menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
        
          1. Source Code.
        
          The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work
        for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source
        form of a work.
        
          A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official
        standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
        interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
        is widely used among developers working in that language.
        
          The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other
        than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
        packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
        Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
        Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
        implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
        ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component
        (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
        (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
        produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
        
          The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all
        the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
        work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
        control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
        System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
        programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
        which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
        includes interface definition files associated with source files for
        the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
        linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
        such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
        subprograms and other parts of the work.
        
          The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
        can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
        Source.
        
          The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
        same work.
        
          2. Basic Permissions.
        
          All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
        copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
        conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
        permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
        covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
        content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
        rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
        
          You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
        convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
        in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
        of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
        with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
        the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
        not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
        for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
        and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
        your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
        
          Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
        the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
        makes it unnecessary.
        
          3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
        
          No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
        measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
        11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
        similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
        measures.
        
          When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
        circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
        is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
        the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
        modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
        users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
        technological measures.
        
          4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
        
          You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
        receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
        appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
        keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
        non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
        keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
        recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
        
          You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
        and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
        
          5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
        
          You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
        produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
        terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
        
            a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
            it, and giving a relevant date.
        
            b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
            released under this License and any conditions added under section
            7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
            ""keep intact all notices"".
        
            c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
            License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
            License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
            additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
            regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
            permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
            invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
        
            d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
            Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
            interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
            work need not make them do so.
        
          A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
        works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
        and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
        in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
        ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
        used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
        beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
        in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
        parts of the aggregate.
        
          6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
        
          You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
        of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
        machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
        in one of these ways:
        
            a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
            Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
            customarily used for software interchange.
        
            b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
            written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
            long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
            model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
            copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
            product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
            medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
            more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
            conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
            Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
        
            c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
            written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
            alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
            only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
            with subsection 6b.
        
            d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
            place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
            Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
            further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
            Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
            copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
            may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
            that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
            clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
            Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
            Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
            available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
        
            e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
            you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
            Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
            charge under subsection 6d.
        
          A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
        from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
        included in conveying the object code work.
        
          A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any
        tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
        or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
        into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
        doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
        product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a
        typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
        of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
        actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
        is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
        commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
        the only significant mode of use of the product.
        
          ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods,
        procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
        and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
        a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
        suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
        code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
        modification has been made.
        
          If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
        specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
        part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
        User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
        fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
        Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
        by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
        if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
        modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
        been installed in ROM).
        
          The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
        requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
        for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
        the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
        network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
        adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
        protocols for communication across the network.
        
          Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
        in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
        documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
        source code form), and must require no special password or key for
        unpacking, reading or copying.
        
          7. Additional Terms.
        
          ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this
        License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
        Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
        be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
        that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
        apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
        under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
        this License without regard to the additional permissions.
        
          When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
        remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
        it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
        removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
        additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
        for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
        
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
        add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
        that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
        
            a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
            terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
        
            b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
            author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
            Notices displayed by works containing it; or
        
            c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
            requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
            reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
        
            d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
            authors of the material; or
        
            e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
            trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
        
            f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
            material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
            it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
            any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
            those licensors and authors.
        
          All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further
        restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
        received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
        governed by this License along with a term that is a further
        restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
        a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
        License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
        of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
        not survive such relicensing or conveying.
        
          If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
        must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
        additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
        where to find the applicable terms.
        
          Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
        form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
        the above requirements apply either way.
        
          8. Termination.
        
          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
        provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
        modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
        this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
        paragraph of section 11).
        
          However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
        license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
        provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
        finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
        holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
        prior to 60 days after the cessation.
        
          Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
        reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
        violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
        received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
        copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
        your receipt of the notice.
        
          Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
        licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
        this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
        reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
        material under section 10.
        
          9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
        
          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
        run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
        occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
        to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
        nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
        modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
        not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
        covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
        
          10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
        
          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
        receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
        propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
        for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
        
          An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an
        organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
        organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
        work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
        transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
        licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
        give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
        Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
        the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
        
          You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
        rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
        not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
        rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
        any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
        sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
        
          11. Patents.
        
          A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
        License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
        work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".
        
          A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims
        owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
        hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
        by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
        but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
        consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
        purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant
        patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
        this License.
        
          Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
        patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
        make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
        propagate the contents of its contributor version.
        
          In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express
        agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
        (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
        sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a
        party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
        patent against the party.
        
          If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
        and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
        to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
        publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
        then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
        available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
        patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
        consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
        license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have
        actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
        covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
        in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
        country that you have reason to believe are valid.
        
          If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
        arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
        covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
        receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
        or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
        you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
        work and works based on it.
        
          A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within
        the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
        conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
        specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
        work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
        in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
        to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
        the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
        parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
        patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
        conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
        for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
        contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
        or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
        
          Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
        any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
        otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
        
          12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
        
          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
        excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
        covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
        License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
        not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
        to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
        the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
        License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
        
          13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
        
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
        permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
        under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
        combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
        License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
        but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
        section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
        combination as such.
        
          14. Revised Versions of this License.
        
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
        the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
        be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
        address new problems or concerns.
        
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
        Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
        Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the
        option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
        version or of any later version published by the Free Software
        Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
        GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
        by the Free Software Foundation.
        
          If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
        versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
        public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
        to choose that version for the Program.
        
          Later license versions may give you additional or different
        permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
        author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
        later version.
        
          15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
        
          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
        APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY
        OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
        THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
        IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
        ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        
          16. Limitation of Liability.
        
          IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
        THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
        GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
        USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
        DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
        PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
        EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
        SUCH DAMAGES.
        
          17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
        
          If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
        above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
        reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
        an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
        Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
        copy of the Program in return for a fee.
        
                             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
        
          If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
        possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
        free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
        
          To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
        
            <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
            Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
        
            This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
            it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
            the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
            (at your option) any later version.
        
            This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
            but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
            MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
            GNU General Public License for more details.
        
            You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
            along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
        
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
        
          If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
        notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
        
            <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
            This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
            This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
            under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
        
        The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
        parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
        might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"".
        
          You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
        if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary.
        For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
        <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
        
          The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
        into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
        may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
        the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
        Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

              51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
          of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
         
         [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
          as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
          the version number 2.1.]
         
         			    Preamble
         
           The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
         freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
         Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
         free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
         
           This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
         specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
         Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
         can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
         this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
         strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
         
           When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
         not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
         you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
         for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
         it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
         it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
         these things.
         
           To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
         distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
         rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
         you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
         
           For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
         or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
         you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
         code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
         complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
         with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
         it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
         
           We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
         library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
         permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
         
           To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
         there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
         modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
         that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
         author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
         introduced by others.
         
           Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
         any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
         effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
         restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
         any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
         consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
         
           Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
         ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
         General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
         is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
         this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
         libraries into non-free programs.
         
           When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
         a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
         combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
         General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
         entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
         Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
         the library.
         
           We call this license the ""Lesser"" General Public License because it
         does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
         Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
         of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
         are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
         libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
         special circumstances.
         
           For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
         encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
         a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
         allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
         library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
         case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
         software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
         
           In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
         programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
         free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
         non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
         operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
         system.
         
           Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
         users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
         linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
         that program using a modified version of the Library.
         
           The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
         modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
         ""work based on the library"" and a ""work that uses the library"".  The
         former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
         be combined with the library in order to run.
         
         		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
         
           0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
         program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
         other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
         this Lesser General Public License (also called ""this License"").
         Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".
         
           A ""library"" means a collection of software functions and/or data
         prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
         (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
         
           The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or work
         which has been distributed under these terms.  A ""work based on the
         Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work under
         copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
         portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
         straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
         included without limitation in the term ""modification"".)
         
           ""Source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
         making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
         all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
         interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
         and installation of the library.
         
           Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
         covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
         running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
         such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
         on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
         writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
         and what the program that uses the Library does.
           
           1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
         complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
         you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
         appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
         all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
         warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
         Library.
         
           You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
         and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
         fee.
         
           2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
         of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
         distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
         above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
         
             a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
         
             b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
             stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
         
             c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
             charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
         
             d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
             table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
             the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
             is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
             in the event an application does not supply such function or
             table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
             its purpose remains meaningful.
         
             (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
             a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
             application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
             application-supplied function or table used by this function must
             be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
             root function must still compute square roots.)
         
         These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
         identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
         and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
         themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
         sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
         distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
         on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
         this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
         entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
         it.
         
         Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
         your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
         exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
         collective works based on the Library.
         
         In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
         with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
         a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
         the scope of this License.
         
           3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
         License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
         this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
         that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
         instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
         ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
         that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
         these notices.
         
           Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
         that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
         subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
         
           This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
         the Library into a program that is not a library.
         
           4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
         derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
         under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
         it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
         must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
         medium customarily used for software interchange.
         
           If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
         from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
         source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
         distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
         compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
         
           5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
         Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
         linked with it, is called a ""work that uses the Library"".  Such a
         work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
         therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
         
           However, linking a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library
         creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
         contains portions of the Library), rather than a ""work that uses the
         library"".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
         Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
         
           When a ""work that uses the Library"" uses material from a header file
         that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
         derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
         Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
         linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
         threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
         
           If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
         structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
         functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
         file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
         work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
         Library will still fall under Section 6.)
         
           Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
         distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
         Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
         whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
         
           6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
         link a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library to produce a
         work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
         under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
         modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
         engineering for debugging such modifications.
         
           You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
         Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
         this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
         during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
         copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
         directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
         of these things:
         
             a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
             machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
             changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
             Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
             with the Library, with the complete machine-readable ""work that
             uses the Library"", as object code and/or source code, so that the
             user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
             executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
             that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
             Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
             to use the modified definitions.)
         
             b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
             Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
             copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
             rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
             will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
             the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
             interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
         
             c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
             least three years, to give the same user the materials
             specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
             than the cost of performing this distribution.
         
             d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
             from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
             specified materials from the same place.
         
             e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
             materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
         
           For an executable, the required form of the ""work that uses the
         Library"" must include any data and utility programs needed for
         reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
         the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
         normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
         components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
         which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
         the executable.
         
           It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
         restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
         accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
         use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
         distribute.
         
           7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
         Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
         facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
         library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
         the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
         permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
         
             a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
             based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
             facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
             Sections above.
         
             b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
             that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
             where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
         
           8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
         the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
         attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
         distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
         rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
         or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
         terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
         
           9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
         signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
         distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
         prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
         modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
         Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
         all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
         the Library or works based on it.
         
           10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
         Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
         original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
         subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
         restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
         You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
         this License.
         
           11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
         infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
         conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
         otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
         excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
         distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
         License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
         may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
         license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
         all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
         the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
         refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
         
         If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
         particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
         and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
         
         It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
         patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
         such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
         integrity of the free software distribution system which is
         implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
         generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
         through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
         system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
         to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
         impose that choice.
         
         This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
         be a consequence of the rest of this License.
         
           12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
         certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
         original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
         an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
         so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
         excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
         written in the body of this License.
         
           13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
         versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
         Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
         but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
         
         Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
         specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
         ""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and
         conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
         the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
         license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
         the Free Software Foundation.
         
           14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
         programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
         write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
         copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
         Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
         decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
         of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
         and reuse of software generally.
         
         			    NO WARRANTY
         
           15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
         WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
         EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
         OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
         KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
         IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
         PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
         LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
         THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
         
           16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
         WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
         AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
         FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
         CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
         LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
         RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
         FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
         SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
         DAMAGES.
         
         		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
         
           If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
         possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
         everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
         redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
         ordinary General Public License).
         
           To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
         safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
         convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
         ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
         
             <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
             Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
         
             This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
             modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
             License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
             version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
         
             This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
             but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
             MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
             Lesser General Public License for more details.
         
             You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
             License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
             Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
         
         Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
         
         You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
         school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the library, if
         necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
         
           Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
           library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              ""License"" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              ""Licensor"" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              ""Legal Entity"" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              ""control"" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              ""You"" (or ""Your"") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              ""Source"" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              ""Object"" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              ""Work"" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, ""submitted""
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as ""Not a Contribution.""
        
              ""Contributor"" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
